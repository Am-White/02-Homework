**CSS**
* Consolidated all classes and groups of code in order to better see and understand how the CSS code works together
* Reorganized how items were ordered, so the CSS code flows along with the webpage
* Added a @media affect in order to better set up the sections when the webpage size shrinks (The benefits information on the right hand side flows to the bottom of the page and aligns in a row)
* Made sure words and images within the content didn't spill over when window size changed (<flex>)
